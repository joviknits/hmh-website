# Project Conventions: Image Organization

This document outlines the organization of product images in this project for the Gemini assistant to reference.

## Image Formats

- **JPEG (.jpg):** The primary format for content images in the `categories`, `featured`, and `patterns` directories.
- **WebP (.webp):** A modern, efficient image format provided as an alternative to JPEG for all content images.
- **PNG (.png):** Used exclusively for logo images, which supports transparency.

## Image Dimensions and Aspect Ratios

The images are consistently organized by aspect ratio and size, depending on their purpose:

- **`images-optimized/patterns/`**
